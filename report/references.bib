    abstract = "{Random sampling of metabolic fluxes can provide a comprehensive description of the capabilities of a metabolic network. However, current sampling approaches do not model thermodynamics explicitly, leading to inaccurate predictions of an organism’s potential or actual metabolic operations.We present a probabilistic framework combining thermodynamic quantities with steady-state flux constraints to analyze the properties of a metabolic network. It includes methods for probabilistic metabolic optimization and for joint sampling of thermodynamic and flux spaces. Applied to a model of E. coli, we use the methods to reveal known and novel mechanisms of substrate channeling, and to accurately predict reaction directions and metabolite concentrations. Interestingly, predicted flux distributions are multimodal, leading to discrete hypotheses on E. coli’s metabolic capabilities.Python and MATLAB packages available at https://gitlab.com/csb.ethz/pta.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Overall, the method greatly reduces the uncertainty of thermodynamic variables.We present multiTFA, a Python implementation of our framework. We evaluated our application using the core Escherichia coli model and achieved a median reduction of 6.8 kJ/mol in reaction Gibbs free energy ranges, while three out of 12 reactions in glycolysis changed from reversible to irreversible.Our framework along with documentation is available on https://github.com/biosustain/multitfa.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = "To the Editor:Extracting knowledge from the many types of big data produced by high-throughput methods remains a challenge, even when data are from Escherichia coli, the best characterized bacterial species. Here, we present iML1515, the most complete genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network in E. coli K-12 MG1655 to date, and we demonstrate how it can be used to address this challenge. Enabling analysis of several data types, including transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, iML1515 accounts for 1,515 open reading frames and 2,719 metabolic reactions involving 1,192 unique metabolites. The iML1515 knowledgebase is linked to 1,515 protein structures to provide an integrated modeling framework bridging systems and structural biology. We apply iML1515 to build metabolic models of E. coli human gut microbiome strains from metagenomic sequencing data. We then use iML1515 to build metabolic models for E. coli clinical isolates and predict their metabolic capabilities. Finally, we use iML1515 to carry out a comparative structural proteome analysis of 1,122 E. coli strains and identify multi-strain sequence variations.",
