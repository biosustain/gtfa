\section*{Introduction}

% TODO: Longer intro to the field in general?
Modelling of feasible intracellular fluxes has long been a key task in metabolic engineering.
If little data is available, the space of valid fluxes can be relatively large, limited only by fundamental reaction stoichiometry and mass-balance laws:
\[
    0 = S\cdot \mathbf{v} \label{eq:steady_state}
\].
If more data is available, this space can be further constrained by known kinetics and regulatory interactions of metabolic enzymes.
A single most-parsimonious solution can then be obtained, with parsiomny determined by maximising biomass production, nearness to measured data or other objective functions {TODO: Others?}.
However, it is a difficult task for these simple measures of parsimony to define true intracellular conditions from such large spaces of viable fluxes.
An alternative is to characterise the entire space of vaiable fluxes, usually with some form of sampling. {TODO: Further references here}

Methods 1,2 {TODO: Research these} were developed to sample uniformly from the space of steady-state fluxes.
Saa {TODO: Citation} extended these methods to exclude loops from the flux space, which are known to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
Alternatively, one can simply include thermodynamic constraints which addresses the problem of loops while excluding further fluxes that violate thermodynamics.
In this case, for all reacitons, the Gibbs' energy of reaction ($\dgr$) must be less than 0.
In practice, the $\dgr$ of reaction $i$ is calculated as the sum of the Gibbs energy of reaction under standard conditions ($\sdgr$) and the scaled logarithm of products over reactants (\ref{eq:dgr})
\begin{align}
    \dgr_i &= \sdgr_i + RT\ln \frac{P}{R} \label{eq:dgr}
\end{align}
where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature and $P$ and $R$ are the concentrations of the reaction's products and reactants respectively.
Because the Gibbs energy of a reaction is a state function, the $\dgr$ and $\sdgr$ of a reaction are equivalent to the Gibbs energy of formation ($\dgf$) and standard Gibbs energy of formation ($\sdgf$) respectively of all reaction substrates, when scaled by their stoichiometries.
That is,
\[
    \sdgr_i = s_i \cdot \sdgf_i
\]
where $s_i \in \mathbb{Z}^{m_i}$ are the stoichiometries and $\sdgf \in \mathbb{R}^{m_i}$ are the standard formations energies of metabolites $1,\dots,m_i$ involved in reaction $i$.

For a set of reactions $1,\dots,r$ ($\bdgr \in \mathbb{R^r}$), this can also be written in matrix form as
\begin{align}
        \bdgr &= \bsdgr + RT \cdot S^{T}\ln{\mathbf{c}} \label{eq:dgr_vec}\\
              &= RT \cdot S^T (\sdgf + RT \ln{\mathbf{c}}) \label{eq:dgr_sdgf_vec}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^m$ is the concentration of all metabolites $1,\dots,m$ in $S$.
Eq~\ref{eq:dgr_vec} shows the relation between the $\dgr$ and $\sdgr$ and Eq~\ref{eq:dgr_sdgf_vec} shows how the same can be calculated with the $\sdgf$.
This formulation also nicely highlights the fact that $\dgr$, $\bsdgr$ and $\ln{\mathbf{c}}$ are linearly related.
As these values are estimated, another benefit of Eq~\ref{eq:dgr_sdgf_vec} becomes clear, namely that all combinations of $\sdgf$ produce a system that is thermodynamically consistent.
An arbitrarily chosen set of $\sdgr$ does not satisfy this property (see~\cite{noor_2013_equilibrator} for a more thorough description of this effect).

% A more natural way to incorporate this probabilistic information would be to sample parameter sets accoring to their
% likelihood. Any optimisation after this point can be by selecting the best one but balancing the likelihood of it
% being present.

Both $\mathbf{c}$ and $\sdgf$ can not be known for certain and need to be estimated, which creates a degree of uncertainty about their true values.
To account for this uncertainty, some margin of error needs to be included to ensure that the true intracellular conditions can be represented.
TMFA {TODO: Etc} define this margin of error for $\sdgr$ and metabolite concentrations by constraining them individually to fall within the 95\% confidence interval.
% TODO: Whole paragraph on the multivariate approach? It's kinda relevant.
~\cite{multiTFA} and~\cite{PTA} improve upon this approach by constraining these values to a 95\% confidence interval of their joint probability, significantly tightening the bounds on possible values.
However, both of these methods discard useful probabistic information about these parameters, effectively treating all values within the confidence interval as equally likely.
~\cite{PTA} {TODO: The exact method} addresses this problem by sampling from the space of valid thermodynamic orthants, i.e. flux directions, with the probabilty of each orthant determined by the probability of $\sdgr$ and metabolite concentrations within it.
Unfortunately, this method still restricts the space of valid concentrations and $\sdgr$ to the 95\% confidence interval, although, to the authors' knowledge, this is not necessary.
Additionally, the hit-and-run sampling method described in~\cite{PTA} requires multiple linear programming evaluations per sample, to ensure that samples satisfy steady state (Eq \ref{eq:steady_state}), which can inhibit computational performance.

In this work, I present an alternative approach to defining and sampling from the space of fluxes that satisfy both steady-state and thermodynamic constraints.
Generative Thermodynamic Flux Analysis (GTFA) is a method for sampling thermodynamically valid fluxes with respect to the probability that these fluxes match measured metabolite concentrations and standard formation energies.
We represent fluxes as a function of their $\dgr$ multiplied by a scaling factor and separate the network into a set of "fixed" and "free" fluxes.
This results in a parameter space where all combinations of parameters satisfy mass balance and thermodynamic constraints, as opposed to \cite{PTA}, where large portions of the $\dgr$ parameter space are invalid and must be avoided.
Furthermore, GTFA allows the inclusion of metabolomics, proteomics and fluxomics data.
The final output of GTFA is then a set thermodynamically-valid fluxes, which respects the probability of each of these varied data sources.

% TODO: Maybe some examples? Slower explanation of how there is probabilistic information attached to all of these measurements?

\section*{Materials and methods}

GTFA unifies metabolomics, fluxomics and enzyme proteomics data of a metabolic network in a generative statistical model.
That is, all measurements are assumed to be subject to measurement error and have true latent counterparts in the model.
Structurally, fluxes and thermodynamic data are forced to satisfy both steady state \ref{eq:steady_state} and thermodynamics.
% TODO: Which law of thermodynamics?

% TODO Ranges here?
Thermodynamic validty is ensured by representing a reaction's flux $v_i$ as a function of its Gibbs energy of reaction $\dgr_i$ scaled by the enzyme concentration $e_i$ and a scaling factor $b_i$, with $v_i>0$ and $v_i<0$ representing flux in the forward and reverse direciton respectively.
This can be represented for the entire metabolic network as follows:
\[
    \bdgr = \dgr\odot\mathbf{e}\odot\mathbf{b}
\]
where $\odot$ represents elementwise multiplication of the vectors, also known as the Hammard product.
