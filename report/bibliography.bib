  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

    abstract = "{Random sampling of metabolic fluxes can provide a comprehensive description of the capabilities of a metabolic network. However, current sampling approaches do not model thermodynamics explicitly, leading to inaccurate predictions of an organism’s potential or actual metabolic operations.We present a probabilistic framework combining thermodynamic quantities with steady-state flux constraints to analyze the properties of a metabolic network. It includes methods for probabilistic metabolic optimization and for joint sampling of thermodynamic and flux spaces. Applied to a model of E. coli, we use the methods to reveal known and novel mechanisms of substrate channeling, and to accurately predict reaction directions and metabolite concentrations. Interestingly, predicted flux distributions are multimodal, leading to discrete hypotheses on E. coli’s metabolic capabilities.Python and MATLAB packages available at https://gitlab.com/csb.ethz/pta.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = "To the Editor:Extracting knowledge from the many types of big data produced by high-throughput methods remains a challenge, even when data are from Escherichia coli, the best characterized bacterial species. Here, we present iML1515, the most complete genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network in E. coli K-12 MG1655 to date, and we demonstrate how it can be used to address this challenge. Enabling analysis of several data types, including transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, iML1515 accounts for 1,515 open reading frames and 2,719 metabolic reactions involving 1,192 unique metabolites. The iML1515 knowledgebase is linked to 1,515 protein structures to provide an integrated modeling framework bridging systems and structural biology. We apply iML1515 to build metabolic models of E. coli human gut microbiome strains from metagenomic sequencing data. We then use iML1515 to build metabolic models for E. coli clinical isolates and predict their metabolic capabilities. Finally, we use iML1515 to carry out a comparative structural proteome analysis of 1,122 E. coli strains and identify multi-strain sequence variations.",
