  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Applied to a model of E. coli, we use the methods to reveal known and novel mechanisms of substrate channeling, and to accurately predict reaction directions and metabolite concentrations.

Here, we present iML1515, the most complete genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network in E. coli K-12 MG1655 to date, and we demonstrate how it can be used to address this challenge. Enabling analysis of several data types, including transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, iML1515 accounts for 1,515 open reading frames and 2,719 metabolic reactions involving 1,192 unique metabolites. The iML1515 knowledgebase is linked to 1,515 protein structures to provide an integrated modeling framework bridging systems and structural biology. We apply iML1515 to build metabolic models of E. coli human gut microbiome strains from metagenomic sequencing data. We then use iML1515 to build metabolic models for E. coli clinical isolates and predict their metabolic capabilities. Finally, we use iML1515 to carry out a comparative structural proteome analysis of 1,122 E. coli strains and identify multi-strain sequence variations.",

abstract = {A new form of metabolic flux analysis (MFA) called thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis (TMFA) is introduced with the capability of generating thermodynamically feasible flux and metabolite activity profiles on a genome scale. TMFA involves the use of a set of linear thermodynamic constraints in addition to the mass balance constraints typically used in MFA. TMFA produces flux distributions that do not contain any thermodynamically infeasible reactions or pathways, and it provides information about the free energy change of reactions and the range of metabolite activities in addition to reaction fluxes. TMFA is applied to study the thermodynamically feasible ranges for the fluxes and the Gibbs free energy change, ΔrG′, of the reactions and the activities of the metabolites in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli developed by Palsson and co-workers. In the TMFA of the genome scale model, the metabolite activities and reaction ΔrG′ are able to achieve a wide range of values at optimal growth. The reaction dihydroorotase is identified as a possible thermodynamic bottleneck in E. coli metabolism with a ΔrG′ constrained close to zero while numerous reactions are identified throughout metabolism for which ΔrG′ is always highly negative regardless of metabolite concentrations. As it has been proposed previously, these reactions with exclusively negative ΔrG′ might be candidates for cell regulation, and we find that a significant number of these reactions appear to be the first steps in the linear portion of numerous biosynthesis pathways. The thermodynamically feasible ranges for the concentration ratios ATP/ADP, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H, and Hextracellular+/Hintracellular+ are also determined and found to encompass the values observed experimentally in every case. Further, we find that the NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH ratios maintained in the cell are close to the minimum feasible ratio and maximum feasible ratio, respectively.}

It has been possible to put the oxidized and reduced forms of some reactants in this table because their standard apparent reduction potentials are known at pH 7. This paper emphasizes redox reactions. Two applications have been made of these 62 new values of standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation at pH 7: (1) They have been used to calculate standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation of 16 more biochemical reactants from measurements of apparent equilibrium constants of redox reactions.(2) They have been used to calculate standard apparent reduction potentials at pH 7 for half reactions involving reactants discussed in this article and the previous one. This table of standard apparent reduction potentials can be extended considerably from known apparent equilibrium constants for enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions. This brings the total number of reactants for which the standard transformed Gibbs energy of formation at 298K, pH 7, and ionic strengths of 0, 0.10, and 0.25 M have been calculated to 142.}

Gibbs free energy contribution values were estimated for 74 distinct molecular substructures and 11 interaction factors using multiple linear regression against a training set of 645 reactions and 224 compounds. The standard error for the fitted values was 1.90kcal/mol. Cross-validation analysis was utilized to determine the accuracy of the methodology in estimating ΔrG′° and ΔfG′° for reactions and compounds not included in the training set, and based on the results of the cross-validation, the standard error involved in these estimations is 2.22kcal/mol. This group contribution method is demonstrated to be capable of estimating ΔrG′° and ΔfG′° for the majority of the biochemical compounds and reactions found in the iJR904 and iAF1260 genome-scale metabolic models of Escherichia coli and in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and University of Minnesota Biocatalysis and Biodegradation Database.

abstract = {Summary
Hundreds of molecular-level changes within central metabolism allow a cell to adapt to the changing environment. A primary challenge in cell physiology is to identify which of these molecular-level changes are active regulatory events. Here, we introduce pseudo-transition analysis, an approach that uses multiple steady-state observations of 13C-resolved fluxes, metabolites, and transcripts to infer which regulatory events drive metabolic adaptations following environmental transitions. Pseudo-transition analysis recapitulates known biology and identifies an unexpectedly sparse, transition-dependent regulatory landscape: typically a handful of regulatory events drive adaptation between carbon sources, with transcription mainly regulating TCA cycle flux and reactants regulating EMP pathway flux. We verify these observations using time-resolved measurements of the diauxic shift, demonstrating that some dynamic transitions can be approximated as monotonic shifts between steady-state extremes. Overall, we show that pseudo-transition analysis can explore the vast regulatory landscape of dynamic transitions using relatively few steady-state data, thereby guiding time-consuming, hypothesis-driven molecular validations.}
