Both \textcite{gollub_2021_prob_sampling} and \textcite{vishnu_2021_multiTFA} addressed the problem of excessively permissive univariate constraints on metabolite concentrations by reformulating them as a 95\% confidence ellipsoid. This was shown to massively reduce the number of viable direction configurations \cite{gollub_2021_prob_sampling}. \textcite{gollub_2021_prob_sampling} further developed methods for sampling reaction Gibbs energies and fluxes with a Hit and Run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. This was necessary to address the disconnected and discontinuous parameter space, which is fragmented by orthants (i.e. directionality configurations) that do not allow any flux. Their approach on \textit{E. coli} model iML1515 \cite{monk_2017_ecoli} suggests that uncertainty in $\Delta_rG^\deg$ is of less importance than uncertainties in metabolite concentrations $c$.  \todo{Will need actual symbols here}.
